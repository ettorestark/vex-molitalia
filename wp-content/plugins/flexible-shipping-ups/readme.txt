= Do I need a UPS account? =
Yes. UPS WooCommerce uses your account to make a connection to the UPS API. This plugin shows you API Status in the settings section. You can sign up with UPS quickly and easily [on their site](https://www.ups.com/doapp/SignUp).

= How can I configure UPS services? =

There is an option to enable services custom settings. You can set which services are available for your customers. However, UPS WooCommerce shows only services available for a given customer based on their shipping address.

= What is a fallback cost? =

Sometimes API doesn’t respond or return an error. The UPS shipping method is not shown in the checkout by default in such situations. However, you can set the fallback cost. If it is enabled, then in case of any API errors, UPS is shown in the checkout with the fallback cost you set.
